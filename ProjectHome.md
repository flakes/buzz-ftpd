**A new FTP daemon. Written in C++, it aims to replace drftpd (Java crap) as de-facto standard distributed FTP server software.**

Planned features include:
  * Transparent virtual file system (VFS)
  * Fast and reliable MySQL database backend
  * Using available RAM for incoming files (= maximum transfer speed)
  * Management web interface
  * IRC sitebot

You can monitor the current activity on the Source page. Once we have something to showcase, a build/install/setup tutorial and source downloads will be posted to this web site.
